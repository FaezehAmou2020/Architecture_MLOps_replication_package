#An Analysis of MLOps Architectures: A Systematic Mapping Study

This repository contains all the data, scripts, and documents that can assist the readers in replicating our research.
The following are included in this replication package:

The folder ‘data’ includes 4 spreadsheet files containing search results (list of initial papers), snowballing results, data extraction, and data synthesis.

The ‘documents’ folder contains the research design of this study. The current submission is only a subset of the designed research. The protocol includes a broader scope seeking to synthesize a comprehensive architecture of state-of-the-art of MLOps systems. The current study however represents the structural view of the architecture, (RQ1) of the protocol.

All the scripts that help the interested reader to automate parts of the process can be found in the ‘scripts’ folder.

To replicate the process one may consult the protocol.
